### 2048 C# Project

As a part of my certification exam, I had to do a project on a topic I chose and in a programming language I wanted, and because I wanted to impress, I studied a bit of C#.
I chose a simple project in Microsoft Visual Studio that shows my skills in C# and could help me deepen my knowledge.

**The features of this Project:**
1. Can detect arrow keys movement
2. I implemented a scoreboard that keeps track of your high score, even if you closed the game
3. You can download the game on any machine, except it wasn't tested on macOS systems
